<h3 id="hangul">Hangul</h3>
<p><em>Hangul</em> (or <em>Hangeul</em> in South Korea specifically) is quite unique as far as alphabets go. It is a phonetic alphabet, arranged into syllable blocks. Critically, Hangul consonants are <strong>shaped like the way the mouth moves to articulate them</strong>. This makes it a <em>featural alphabet</em>, almost totally unique in the tree of human alphabets.<br>

<blockquote>
<p>ㄱ depicts the root of the tongue blocking the upper palate<br>
ㄴ depicts the tongue touching the upper palate<br>
ㅁ depicts the mouth<br>
ㅅ depicts the incisor<br>
ㅇ depicts the throat</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ㄱ is a <em>k</em> or <em>g</em> sound*<br>
ㄴ is an <em>n</em> sound<br>
ㅁ makes an <em>m</em> sound<br>
ㅅ makes a <em>s</em> or <em>t</em> sound*<br>
ㅇ is silent at the begininng of a syllable, but may be a glottal stop in some circumstances<br>
*(The letters with alternate sounds change their sound based on whether they are the final consonant of a syllable)</p>
<h3 id="how-to-spell-letters">How to Spell Letters</h3>
<p>Now, here’s where we go from a literal description of reality to the weird shit.</p>
<p>Much like how Hebrew letters have their own names which can be written <em>in Hebrew</em>, such as the letter “Ayin” being both the letter ע and the name עַיִן‎, Hangul letters exist similarly.</p>
<p>For instance, ㅅ is known as a “siot”, written <em>in</em> Hangul as 시옷 (notably, the first block containing the letter itself, much like how Ayin is written <em>with</em> an ayin).</p>
<p>(OK, we’re still in reality but this is where the car stops suddenly and we get flung out the window.)</p>
<p>When we look at the City, we can see it’s split into Districts that are owned by the Wings. We’re all familiar with the Wings, such as K Corp, W Corp, or L Corp, but just like each each Hangul letter has its own name, each Wing has its own full name that its initialism expands into.</p>
<p>L stood for Lobotomy. W stands for Warp. N stands for Nagel und Hammer.</p>
<p>Now, while these aren’t necessarily obligate mysteries to the <em>characters</em>, they are to us, and notably, characters often still use the short forms of these names out of convenience when speaking to similarly informed people.</p>
<p>But I got to thinking. You cannot necessarily make a coherent ‘word’ with only a single letter most of the time. Similarly, most Wings have some form of partnership in order to function at their peak capacity. Here, we get into the notion of cooperation and conflict.</p>
<h2 id="equal-wingbeats">Equal Wingbeats</h2>
<h3 id="time-and-space">Time and Space</h3>
<p>Take, for instance, the partnership between T Corp and W Corp.</p>
<p>T Corp is always having to harvest Time in order to run its operation. W Corp can always benefit from outside investment to keep themselves afloat whether their business is struggling a little (Ruina) or a LOT (Limbus).</p>
<p>T Corp’s boxes get to harvest the Time generated from emotional turmoil within the trains, and W Corp gets some lovely kickbacks, in addition to the possibility that the technology is actually part of what allows Warp Trains to move within the alternate dimension(s) they have to cut through.</p>
<p>Similarly, T Corp’s time-acceleration tech allows R Corp to run their Hatcheries fast enough to actually breed powerful mercenaries (in the Battle Royale hellscape we see Myo or R-Sault inhabit) without violating A Corp’s strict limitation on the prolonged existence of clones.</p>
<p>Now, before we continue, I would like to make a brief sidebar: the nature of languages, versus syllables, versus words, and the hidden meaning underneath a name. When Cityfolk know the ‘handle’ of a Wing, but not necessarily its greater meaning- or worse, they know it, but don’t care- some essence of the thing is lost, because the ‘letter’ became an interchangeable block without its own discrete meaning.</p>
<p>Back to the main stream. There is a much, much more elaborate demonstration of cross-Wing cooperation, and it is in fact the <em>first</em> such cooperation we are introduced to, in the <em>first</em> entry of the series: Lobotomy Corporation itself.</p>
<h3 id="l-corp">L Corp</h3>
<p>On a very simple, mechanical level, the creation, design, and function of the Headquarters is contingent on the deals made between L Corp and several others:</p>
<ul>
<li>The HP Bullets used to heal Agents in the field are a technology from K Corp, their <em>Helapoiesis</em> bullets, which we see demonstrated later on their own guards.</li>
<li>The TT2 protocol used to manipulate time in the enclosed facility is an explicit invention of T Corp. (Several other TT(n) variants exist.)</li>
<li>The Rabbit Protocol that can be invoked involves a contract between L Corp and R Corp, with Myo as its very representative in a cutscene.</li>
<li>There is at least one usage of W Corp technology in the facility in order to get the Rabbits into it, and there is a massive W-branded pad that may be a teleportation hub of some kind in the Disciplinary Department (which is backed up, I think, by Gebura having history with Myo)<br>

<h3 id="synthesis-of-sound">Synthesis of Sound</h3>
<p>BUT WAIT THERE’S MORE</p>
<p>ok wait only if i can find the dialogue line about it</p>
<p>Okay well, this one’s vibes so take it with a big grain of salt, but if I recall correctly, part of the reason Angela exists at all is that same cooperation between Wings, and it was her future creation that caused the raid on the Old Lab in the first place, not the existence of the Seed of Light project</p>
<p>Still, her growth into more of a human was partly enabled by this consortium between these different Wings.</p>
<p>And so I suggest the following: when a letter is alone, it is often just a letter. When there are letters together, they can form a syllable. When there are syllables together, you can form a <em>word</em>.</p>
<p>When the Wings, the Letters, are kept fractious and separate from each other, never quite absorbing the other in war nor cooperating in peace; when the Cityfolk think only in terms of the surface-level, not permitted even to easily travel between the Districts; people are kept thinking only in terms of those single letters. When people don’t know, or don’t care about, the greater meaning of a Wing’s letter, the essence is lost. When they can’t use these letters together, they can’t form syllables, can’t form words, can’t form a mutual language that connects ideas and individuals together.</p>
<h2 id="the-body-politic">The Body Politic</h2>
<p>The City exists in a constant crucible that never permits total anarchy nor complete peace. If a Wing or force reigned dominant, it would absorb the rest. If they cooperated fully, they might not grow, which would be disastrous if they were truly meant to become strong enough to <em>each</em> defend the City against the Outskirts or something else.</p>
<p>And much like Hangul consonants mimic the mouth, the Head, the Eye, the Claw, the Wings, the Feathers, all mimic some terrible vigilant bird. The Fingers making the Hand of the Backstreets are terribly human, in their hierarchy, their faith, their brotherhood, their perspective, their zeal.</p>
<p>And in fact, if you look at the three Districts tied to the Head, A Corp, B Corp, and C Corp, together they resemble a lateral view of the human brain.</p>
<h3 id="the-nervous-center">The Nervous Center</h3>
<ul>
<li>See the ‘dip’ in A Corp? That’s the region of the cerebellum and the brainstem.</li>
<li>See the ‘back’ in B Corp? That’s the occipital/parietal lobes.</li>
<li>See the ‘front’ or ‘overhang’ in C Corp? That’s the frontal lobe and how it projects forward.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite being at the ‘bottom’ of the triad by being the most southerly, A Corp is also one of the most primordially powerful Wings even within the triad, the place of Arbiters, the definer of the timescale that everything else follows.</p>
<p>The Cerebellum is critical to motor control and cognition, but also, close to it is the brain stem connecting the brain to the rest of the nervous system and spine. If you destroy the brainstem, a human being dies. Cut Cityfolk off at the neck? They can be preserved, with H Corp technology. Cut the right part of the head? Pierce or crush their skull in the right manner? Cut them vertically down the middle? They’re dead and buried unless you have something like Dante’s clock.</p>
<p>Similarly, maybe, just maybe, the Head survive absent their Beholders or their Claws, if in a massively weakened state. But without Arbiters? Those magical adjudicators of what is the utmost, most primal, sacred law in the City, sent to expunge ‘Impurities’? Would the City even survive, much less resemble itself without the power of the Arbiters?</p>
<p>So in that sense, I say thus: the anatomy of letters is the anatomy of speech; the anatomy of speech is the anatomy of language; the anatomy of language is the anatomy of society. And the anatomy of the Head is the anatomy of the brain.</p>
<p>And the anatomy of the brain<br>
is the anatomy<br>
of humanity.</p>
