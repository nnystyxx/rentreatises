<h1 id="episode-3-the-ordeals-of-green">Episode 3: The Ordeals of Green</h1>
<p>The Ordeals of Green are not an unfamiliar topic to me. I’ve explored their meaning as it concerns the Machine Purge, but here, I want to tackle a different angle on the murderous machines, through the previous metaphor of ‘roots’.</p>
<p>What do you suppose a robot is made of? More often than not, it is metal. But more specifically, it is made of the Earth.</p>
<p>Iron wrenched from the earth.</p>
<p>Coal made from dead plant matter that was heated and presesd for millions of years; thus is made steel. Their skin. Their bones.</p>
<p>Oil made much the same. Their blood. Smoke, their air.</p>
<p>Glass made of sand, ground and baked. Their eye-lids.</p>
<p>Wires and chips made of coppers, silvers and golds. Their nerves, their brains.</p>
<p>But a plant springs too from the Earth, does it not? Drinks of its water, eats of its soil? True. But the plant is bade back to the earth from which it came.</p>
<p>Metal falls and rusts, oil burns and smokes, glass is worn back to sand, but do most of those things ever have the chance to really ‘return’?</p>
<p>Human beings, too, are said to be beasts of clay, given breath and life by our maker, but when we die, that clay too returns. Bones crack and wither, skin rots, muscle decays. Something is given back to nature that was taken.</p>
<p>So, the Green Dawn, as Machine-Life, are made from these things wrenched from the earth, but they don’t belong ‘to’ it, ‘underneath’ it the way plants and animals do.</p>
<p>And nor do they belong ‘On’ it.</p>
<h2 id="doubt">Doubt</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>One day, a question crossed through my mind. Where do we come from? We were given life and left in this world against our own volition.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To live was a process full of pain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They were made as mimicries of life, moving, hating, working, killing, but not belonging, not ‘Living’.</p>
<h2 id="process-of-understanding">Process of Understanding</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the end, they were bound to life. We existed only to express despair and ire.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We will understand life and the soul with our own hands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before we continue, I’d like to point something out about the Green Dawn and Green Noon entities: both of them are weak to WHITE damage.</p>
<p>They endure RED, are vulnerable to BLACK, and have about the same PALE resistance as anything else at 1.0.</p>
<p>The Green Dawn or Doubt entities also have the dubious accolade of being able to cause area WHITE damage by mercilessly ripping apart any employee they kill and showering the room in gore.</p>
<p>They are vulnerable to that mental oppression, but they are also so familiar with it that they know how to inflict it on other human beings with an overwhelming show of violence.</p>
<p>But BLACK damage, the ‘corroding thorns’ that tear at both their physical steel and their mental stability, are terrifyingly effective, attacking and degrading <em>what they’re made of</em> and <em>why they exist</em> from two angles.</p>
<h2 id="where-we-must-reach">Where We Must Reach</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We constructed a looming tower to return whence we came.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There wasn’t an answer. We didn’t find a single thing we wanted. We only witnessed the death of life itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These creatures that didn’t belong in the Earth, and didn’t belong on the Earth, sought to instead become Above the earth.</p>
<h2 id="helix-of-the-end">Helix of the End</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The tower is touched by the sky, and nothing will remain on the ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Who pays for the suffering and neglect of the lives given to us?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Some people interpret ‘the tower is touched by the sky’ as the detonation of a nuclear bomb, though the Helix of the End is a big funky laser.)</p>
<p>Either way, to quote myself feverishly taking notes before I slept earlier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the metal beasts of the green Dawn were ripped from the earth unable to form roots to the minerals used to make them nor to the soil from which mankind comes and to which mankind goes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>they built a high tower to go toward the heavens and leave nothing on the earth because they, made of the Earth, had been denied its return</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>they had been denied its place underneath it or upon it and so they sought to be above it</p>
</blockquote>
