<p><strong>Penitence (weapon)</strong><br>
To know means to understand.<br>
We successfully extracted the archetype and materialized it, and the observer reshaped it into a weapon.<br>
This is why we highly regarded the act of observation.</p>
<p><strong>Penitence (suit)</strong><br>
Conventional firearms were ineffective against Abnormalities; using them was as futile as cutting water with a knife.<br>
That was when we asked ourselves: “If Abnormalities are materialized from the unconsciousness, it may be possible to extract a piece of it back from them and turn it into a weapon.”<br>
Results varied depending on the observer.</p>
<p><strong>Soda (weapon)</strong><br>
This E.G.O was last extracted by an employee who particularly loved shrimp.</p>
<p><strong>Life for a Daredevil (weapon)</strong><br>
An ancient sword.<br>
Just as its archetype desired, it will be useless in the hands of the frightened.</p>
<p><strong>Fragments from Somewhere (weapon, suit)</strong><br>
It took a different form every time it was produced, but we managed to stabilize the gestalt after a lot of effort and trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Solitude (weapon)</strong><br>
A strong sense of loneliness still lingers, even in the form of an E.G.O.<br>
Its bullets create a void that cannot be filled on the victim’s soul, rather than a wound upon their flesh and bones.<br>
It was a rusty weapon from the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Beak (suit)</strong><br>
The suit was originally very small, barely wearable by a child.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth Match Flame</strong> (suit)<br>
The archetype was already charred from the moment of extraction.<br>
Although the exterior is scorched, it has no adverse effects on the E.G.O’s performance.</p>
<p><strong>Grinder Mk4 (suit)</strong><br>
The otherwise sleek coat is covered with bloodstains of an unknown origin.<br>
Some employees may brag about the bloodstain as a symbol of courage, but it has been there since the archetype was extracted. Perhaps it is the commemoration of all the tragedies of the past and the future.<br>
People used to be afraid of machines in the beginning, but a mechanical rebellion soon became a myth of the past in our world.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Bullet (weapon, suit)</strong><br>
Though the original’s power couldn’t be fully extracted, the magic this holds is still potent.</p>
<p><strong>Bear Paws</strong> (weapon)<br>
It’s evident that using this equipment recklessly will cause it to tear, so extra caution is needed.<br>
Some sympathetic employees felt sorry for it and asked for it to be repaired, however the outcome of the repairs was unforeseeable, so the proposal was rejected.</p>
<p><strong>Bear Paws</strong> (suit)<br>
The equipment is made of a material that may have been fluffy once, but now it just looks shabby.<br>
As with any other E.G.O, any attempt to stitch it up is ill advised.</p>
<p><strong>Laetitia</strong> (weapon)<br>
It takes a lot of time to extract, but its power cannot be ignored.</p>
<p><strong>Faint Aroma (weapon)</strong><br>
Even after the E.G.O was extracted, it still carried the fragrance of the archetype.</p>
<p><strong>Justitia (weapon and suit)</strong><br>
The person who extracted this E.G.O was the most righteous person in the company.</p>
<p><strong>Green Stem (weapon)</strong><br>
All personnel involved in the equipment’s production wore heavy protection to prevent them from being influenced by the entity.</p>
<p><strong>Green Stem (suit)</strong><br>
The personnel involved were unable to remove the poison of this E.G.O equipment.</p>
